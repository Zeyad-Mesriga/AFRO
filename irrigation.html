            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Preparing the land for planting:</h3>
                <p>The process of preparing the ground before planting it is considered essential, to provide a suitable medium for the plant roots, as it facilitates their passage in the soil, and provides properties that help the seeds absorb water and nutrients from the soil, and grow, and any previously planted plants are removed, so that they do not deplete the nutrients, and the preparation processes differ. The land depends on the region and the crops, as it gives the plants better results when prepared in the right ways and at appropriate times. The stages of preparing the land for agriculture include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Plowing:</b> It is the process of preparing the land for seed incubation by loosening and stimulating it. There are several factors that affect the efficiency of plowing, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Type of land:</b> Cohesive agricultural lands require breaking up and smoothing operations, and they also need powerful agricultural machines, unlike light lands.
                            </li>

                                <b>Type of previous crop:</b> Residues from previous crops vary from one crop to another, in terms of root depth and soil cohesion. Some residues from previous crops need to increase the number of plowing times, and some residues from previous crops may be used as fertilizer for the new crop, so the land needs early plowing.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Type of crop to be planted:</b> Crops differ from each other in terms of the depth of plowing and their preparation for seed nursery.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Types of weeds and their extent:</b> The soil needs early plowing when there are many weeds in the ground, so that they do not consume the nutrients of the crop to be grown.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Moisture percentage in the soil:</b> High soil moisture leads to the formation of cohesive blocks of soil, which requires increased plowing efficiency, while dry soil requires less efficient plowing.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The use of sprinkler irrigation began in the late 20th century, and its spread increased after World War II after the efficiency of pumps, pipes, and light-duty sprinklers increased. In this method, water is sprayed into the air through small holes in the pipes until it falls on the surface of the soil and plants in the form of rain mist.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The advantage of this method of irrigation with sprinklers is that it enables farmers to add fertilizer and pesticides to the water. It can also be used on uneven lands. It does not require labor, protects plants from frost, and works to maintain their temperature.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One of the harms of this method is that it leads to the appearance of salts on the surface of the soil.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This method depends on irrigating the plants with water in the form of drops directly under the plants, where a network of pipes designated for drip irrigation is designed and distributed among the trees. At the bottom of each tree there is a hole in the pipe from which water emerges in the form of drops.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        The drip irrigation method is suitable for sandy and desert land, and it is very water-saving, giving the trees their water needs without wasting.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        However, one of the disadvantages of this method is that constructing irrigation networks is expensive, and preparing the network requires highly qualified workers.

                    <li>
                        It is considered one of the most common methods, and it is not a modern method, but it is effective. This method depends on designing a network of regular grooves and channels around the trees, and making the water flow through these channels to run through them and reach all the trees, with the necessity of having a drainage system at the end of the waterway.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        The surface irrigation method has several advantages: As it is easy to use, its cost is low, and it does not require trained workers.

                    <li>
                        One of the harms of this method is that it leads to the appearance of salts on the surface of the soil.

                    <li>
                        Bubble irrigation can be defined as an irrigation system that combines drip irrigation and irrigation with sprinklers. This method relies on injecting air into water pipes or tanks, and thus it increases the percentage of oxygen in the water by approximately 150% and thus increases its percentage in the soil, which helps the soil get rid of bacteria. harmful and improve the soil.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This system uses a bubble device that regulates the air flow to the water pipes before starting watering.

                <h3>Subterranean irrigation methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In this irrigation method, the necessary humidity for the plant’s root environment is achieved by controlling the constant level. For this purpose, it is necessary to have a sealing layer at an appropriate depth from the soil surface to control the constant surface. Therefore, this method usually makes the soil surface not wet as long as water is provided in the root environment, where the water level is raised to a high degree so that moisture can reach the root environment using the capillary action.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Irrigation with groundwater allows the distribution of unsaturated moisture in the root zone of the plant. One of the new systems of this method is the use of sponge-like rubber tubes under very low pressure to distribute water evenly under control and by installing it in the root zone of the plant. It creates moisture within the field soil capacity. Choosing the appropriate depth and the optimal distance for these tubes from each other and to the plant depends on the extent of moisture generated by the tube in the soil.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Permeable pipes are not perforated but spongy. In other words, in a permeable system there is no water flow but a moisture space is created around the pipe. The permeable technology is that with very low pressure the water seeps out from the wall of the permeable pipe and after creating a relative nice and uniform humid atmosphere up to To a state of equilibrium with its surroundings the water will be absorbed by the root and the pipe will leak in and we will not have any evaporation in the system.
